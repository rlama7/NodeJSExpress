    <h1>About - </h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Adam Tremarche.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am a computer science student here at SFSU finishing up my degree this
        year and make the leap into the world of software design. Specifically,
        my interest is in game development and I've made a couple simple little
        games using tools like Construct2 and Unity. I've handled both the art
        and mechanical design for all my own projects, so in addition to
        understanding these two development tools I've also handled pixel art
        asset creation as well as animation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
